########################## Metricbeat Configuration ###########################
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/index.html

#============================  Config Reloading ===============================
# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.
metricbeat.config.modules:
  # Glob pattern for configuration reloading
  path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml
  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s
  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: false

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a metricset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
metricbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

#============================== Autodiscover ===================================
# Autodiscover allows you to detect changes in the system and spawn new modules
# as they happen.
metricbeat.autodiscover:
  providers:
    - type: docker
      hints.enabled: true

#==========================  Modules configuration =============================
metricbeat.modules:
  #-------------------------------- Docker Module --------------------------------
  - module: docker
    metricsets:
      - "container"
      - "cpu"
      - "diskio"
      - "healthcheck"
      - "info"
      - "memory"
      - "network"
    hosts: ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
    period: 10s
    enabled: true
    # If set to true, collects metrics per core.
    #cpu.cores: true

# ================================= Processors =================================
# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
processors:
  # The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
  # container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
  # it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
  - add_docker_metadata: ~
  # The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
  - add_host_metadata: ~
  # The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
  # process IDs included in the event.
  - add_process_metadata: ~

# ================================== Outputs ===================================
# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: true
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  hosts: ["http://10.22.157.147:9200"]

# ================================= Dashboards =================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards are disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
# setup.dashboards.enabled: true

# # =================================== Kibana ===================================
# # Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# # This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
# setup.kibana:
#   # Kibana Host
#   # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
#   # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
#   # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
#   host: "kibana-demo:5601"

# ================================== Logging ===================================
# There are four options for the log output: file, stderr, syslog, eventlog
# The file output is the default.
# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
logging.level: info

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Metricbeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
monitoring.enabled: true

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
monitoring.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  #hosts: ["elasticsearch-demo:9200"]

# =============================== HTTP Endpoint ================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.
# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.
# http.enabled: true

# # The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname, IP address, unix socket or named pipe.
# # When using IP addresses, it is recommended to only use localhost.
# http.host: metricbeat-demo

# # Port on which the HTTP endpoint will bind. Default is 5066.
# http.port: 5066
